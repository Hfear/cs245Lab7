"""Creating a Structured Array:

Create a structured NumPy array where each entry contains:

day (integer, 1 to 365)

rainfall (float, in mm)

is_rainy (Boolean, True if rainfall > 0)

Filtering Data with Structured Arrays:

Use Boolean masks on the structured array to extract all rainy days and compute their average rainfall.

Sorting Structured Data:

Sort the structured array by rainfall and print the top 5 rainiest days."""
